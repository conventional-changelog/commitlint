## What is commitlint

commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```text
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```text
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```text
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

These can be modified by [your own configuration](#config).

### Benefits of using commitlint

- [Why Use Conventional Commits?](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#why-use-conventional-commits)
- ["The perks of committing with conventions" (Talk slides)](https://slides.com/marionebl/the-perks-of-committing-with-conventions#/)

## Getting started

- [Local setup](https://commitlint.js.org/guides/local-setup) - Lint messages on commit with husky
- [CI setup](https://commitlint.js.org/guides/ci-setup) - Lint messages during CI builds

## CLI

- Primary way to interact with commitlint.
- `npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli`
- Packages: [cli](./@commitlint/cli)

## Config

- Configuration is picked up from:
  - `.commitlintrc`
  - `.commitlintrc.json`
  - `.commitlintrc.yaml`
  - `.commitlintrc.yml`
  - `.commitlintrc.js`
  - `.commitlintrc.cjs`
  - `.commitlintrc.mjs`
  - `.commitlintrc.ts`
  - `.commitlintrc.cts`
  - `commitlint.config.js`
  - `commitlint.config.cjs`
  - `commitlint.config.mjs`
  - `commitlint.config.ts`
  - `commitlint.config.cts`
  - `commitlint` field in `package.json`
  - `commitlint` field in [`package.yaml`](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/1799)
- Packages: [cli](./@commitlint/cli), [core](./@commitlint/core)
- See [Rules](./docs/reference/rules.md) for a complete list of possible rules
- An example configuration can be found at [@commitlint/config-conventional](./@commitlint/config-conventional/src/index.ts)

## Shared configuration

A number of shared configurations are available to install and use with `commitlint`:

- [@commitlint/config-angular](./@commitlint/config-angular)
- [@commitlint/config-conventional](./@commitlint/config-conventional)
- [@commitlint/config-lerna-scopes](./@commitlint/config-lerna-scopes)
- [@commitlint/config-nx-scopes](./@commitlint/config-nx-scopes)
- [@commitlint/config-patternplate](./@commitlint/config-patternplate)
- [conventional-changelog-lint-config-atom](https://github.com/erikmueller/conventional-changelog-lint-config-atom)
- [conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical](https://github.com/gajus/conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical)
- [commitlint-config-jira](https://github.com/Gherciu/commitlint-jira)

> ⚠️ If you want to publish your own shareable config then make sure it has a name aligning with the pattern `commitlint-config-emoji-log` or `commitlint-config-your-config-name` — then in extend all you have to write is `emoji-log` or `your-config-name`.

EOL is usually after around a year.

We're not a sponsored OSS project. Therefore we can't promise that we will release patch versions for older releases in a timely manner.\
If you are stuck on an older version and need a security patch we're happy if you can provide a PR.
