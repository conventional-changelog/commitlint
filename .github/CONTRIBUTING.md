```sh
yarn install
```

```sh
yarn build
yarn test
```

### Documentation updates

Documentation uses `vitepress`.
To run and edit the documentation locally run:

## Package dependency overview

![commitlint-dependencies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4248851/58385093-34b79780-7feb-11e9-8f27-bffc4aca3eba.png)

(Partly outdated)

## Publishing a release

```sh
npm login
nvm use (if you have nvm installed)
```

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is supported as well

```sh
yarn clean
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
yarn run publish --otp <one-time password>
```

If something in between fails (like a new package was added and needs to be published for the
first time but you forgot) you can use `lerna publish from-package` to publish anything that
has not been published yet.

### Create GitHub release

1. Copy changelog entry for the new version
1. Create release for the new tag: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/releases
1. Post in the [commitlint Slack-channel][12]

### Publish a `next` release (or i.e. patch release)

```sh
npm login
nvm use (if you have nvm installed)
```

```sh
yarn clean
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
npx lerna publish --conventional-commits --dist-tag [`next` | `[release-vXX(BRANCH)]`] --otp <one-time password>
```

If for some reason this stops in between, you can manually publish missing packages like this:

```sh
npm publish <package-name> --tag [`next` | `[release-vXX(BRANCH)]`] --otp <one-time password>
```

#### Publishing (new) packages for the first time

```sh
npm publish [PACKAGE_NAME] --access public
```

From within the folder first i.e. `cd @commitlint/new-packages`.

#### Move `next` to `latest`

```sh
npm login
```

```sh
npx lerna exec --no-bail --no-private --no-sort --stream -- '[ -n "$(npm v . dist-tags.next)" ] && npm dist-tag add ${LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME}@$(npm v . dist-tags.next) latest --otp <one-time password>'
```

Remove next:

```sh
npx lerna exec --no-bail --no-private --no-sort --stream -- '[ -n "$(npm v . dist-tags.next)" ] && npm dist-tag rm ${LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME} next --otp <one-time password>'
```
