# Upgrade Guides

#### CLI

* None

#### Config

* **wildcards** config is ignored - as of version `2.0.0` the former `.wildcards` configuration is ignored entirely. If your `.conventional-changelog-lintrc`, `commitlint.config.js` or an extended shareable configuration has a `.wildcards` key a warning will be issued.

#### API

* None

## Version 2 to 3

```bash
npm remove --save-dev conventional-changelog-lint
npm install --save commitlint
mv .conventional-changelog-lintrc commitlint.config.js
```

* Rename all calls to `conventional-changelog-lint` to `commitlint`

* `.conventional-changelog-lintrc` now is called `commitlint.config.js`

#### API

* `getConfiguration(name, settings, seed)` changed to `load(seed)`
* `getMessages(range)` changed to `read(range)`
