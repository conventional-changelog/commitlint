# Releases

Security patches will be applied to versions which are not yet EOL.  
Features will only be applied to the current main version.

We're not a sponsored OSS project. Therefore we can't promise that we will release patch versions for older releases in a timely manner.  
If you are stuck on an older version and need a security patch we're happy if you can provide a PR.

For a list of releases check our [README](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#releases)
